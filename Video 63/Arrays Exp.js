/*
What are Arrays?
Arrays are the data type which can hold more that one data type in it, like it can hold a string, a number and a bool value at same time in one array.
Like I can store a number, a string, and a bool in one same array without any hesitation in here...

let arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7];

console.log(arr); // This will print the whole array in here
console.log(arr.length); // This will print the length of the array in here
console.log(arr[1]); // This way I can even print the specific element of the array by giving the index number with the array name......
